# GE2-Assignment Budget Club Penguin

All jokes aside, this project is a life simulation of a group of penguins in a glacier surrounded by water. The penguins will have to survive in this glacier, whilst having one of their natural predators also there, the polar bear. The bear will try to track a penguin, and once he does he will then follow him and eventually kill him. The penguins will have to develop ways to evade their predator while also keeping their population afloat through procreation. This project took inspiration from the well-known Game of Life by John Conway.
