# GE2-Assignment Budget Club Penguin

All jokes aside, this project is a life simulation of a group of penguins in a glacier surrounded by water. The penguins will have to survive in this glacier, whilst having one of their natural predators also there, the polar bear. The bear will try to track a penguin, and once he does he will then follow him and eventually kill him. The penguins will have to develop ways to evade their predator while also keeping their population afloat through procreation. This project took inspiration from the well-known Game of Life by John Conway.

## Penguins:

The penguins are kinematic bodies that will spawn in the glacier. Once they spawn, they will walk in a given random location as long as that location does not intersect with another penguin or when it senses the edge of the glacier. This is their initial state however, when the polar bear enters their detection range, it will enter into a fear state, which will make them run in the opposite direction of the polar bear. When two penguins meet, they will lay an egg. The egg will take approximately 3-4 seconds to hatch. While it's an egg the predator will not target it. The penguins will need to periodically feed themselves by eating the fish that comes ashore by the rising sea water.
